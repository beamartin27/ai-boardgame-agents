# AI Game Agents (Ghosts, Quoridor, Uno)

Collection of course projects implementing AI agents / decision-making for board & card games using Python notebooks.

## Projects
### 👻 Ghosts (my main contribution)
- Implemented and tested the agent logic for the Ghosts assignment.
- Focus: state representation, valid moves generation, strategy/heuristics, and evaluation.

### ♟️ Quoridor (group deliverable)
- Notebook exploring agent behavior and game mechanics for Quoridor.

### 🃏 UNO (group deliverable)
- Standalone notebook implementing game logic and agent decisions for UNO.

## Tech
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

## How to run

Create an environment and install common notebook dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook numpy
   ```

Open the notebooks and enjoy!

> Notes: These notebooks were created as part of IE University coursework. My primary work is reflected in the Ghosts notebook.
